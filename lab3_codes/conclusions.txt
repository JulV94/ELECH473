Multiplications (Q3) :
----------------------
SI0 : 51 instructions - execution between 304 and 592 instructions
SI1 : 28 instructions - execution between 264 and 312 instructions
SI2 : 6 instructions - execution is 6 instructions

Numbers are given with the 4 nop at the begining. We see that a more complete set of instructions can reduce the number of instructions needed to perform a task leading in a faster execution since the CPI stays the same in the RiSC architecture. We can also see that the algorithm is less dependent of the inputs for execution time since there is less instructions and less branching (even no branching for the SI2 case)

Comparison (Q2) :
-----------------
We see that SI2 has a dedicated instruction for comparison so the code is obviously much shorter. The code is 3 instructions long for SI2 and 30 for SI1. SI1 code is also made with a loop inside. The execution of SI1 code will be much longer in any case.

Choice of test vectors (Q1) :
-----------------------------
We tested the big and small numbers in all combinations possible. Combinations are :
- positive positive
- positive negative
- negative positive
- negative negative
Then we tested switching operands 1 and 2 and some vectors where operand 1 == operand 2
